This folder contains optional calibration code used to parameterise the
transmission parameter beta.

This workflow is not required to reproduce the main manuscript results.
The main analysis uses precomputed host distributions in main_analysis/.

Subfolders:
- code/: beta sweep scripts
- Outputs/: calibration results
- shapefiles_raw/: raw GIS inputs (not hosted due to file size)
