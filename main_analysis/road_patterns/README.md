This folder contains road network shapefiles used in the main manuscript
optimisation analysis.

These road patterns are used to define accessibility constraints for candidate
surveillance site locations during optimisation.

IMPORTANT:
For each shapefile, all associated files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, etc.) must be
present in the same folder.

These files are REQUIRED to reproduce the optimisation results in the manuscript.
