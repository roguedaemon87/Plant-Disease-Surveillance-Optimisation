These .joblib files contain precomputed host distribution landscapes used in the
main manuscript analysis.

Each file (area01.joblib, area02.joblib, ...) stores a spatial grid of host
availability/density used as input to the spread simulation.

These files are REQUIRED to reproduce the main manuscript simulations.

Note:
They were generated prior to the main analysis using GIS layers and processing.
The raw GIS layers used to generate host distributions are not required for the
main manuscript workflow and are not included here.
