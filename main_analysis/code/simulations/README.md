Scripts in this folder run stochastic epidemic simulations on the precomputed
host distributions.

These simulations generate multiple realisations of pathogen spread and are
used as inputs for the optimisation step.

Required inputs:
- main_analysis/host_distributions/

Outputs:
- Simulation result .joblib files (written by the scripts in this folder).
