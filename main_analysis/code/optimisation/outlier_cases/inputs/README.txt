Inputs for the outlier case investigations (road metric outliers).

These inputs reproduce the diagnostic optimisation runs where road-based
metrics gave unexpectedly poor surveillance performance.

Included scenarios (confirmed with co-author):
- area01 with road patterns 01_0 and 01_1
- area05 with road patterns 05_0, 05_1, and 05_2

Subfolders:
- host_distributions/ : required host landscape inputs (.joblib)
- road_patterns/      : required road network shapefiles for these cases
