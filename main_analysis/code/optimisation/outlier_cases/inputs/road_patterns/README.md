Road network shapefiles for outlier cases.

Required road patterns:
- area01: roadnetwork01_0.*, roadnetwork01_1.*
- area05: roadnetwork05_0.*, roadnetwork05_1.*, roadnetwork05_2.*

IMPORTANT:
Upload each shapefile as a complete set of companion files (.shp, .shx, .dbf,
.prj, etc.) with the same filename stem.
