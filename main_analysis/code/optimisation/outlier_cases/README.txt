Outlier case investigations for road-based surveillance metrics.

These scripts were used to examine specific scenarios in which simple road-based
accessibility metrics did not accurately predict surveillance performance.

The cases focus on:
- area01 with road patterns 01_0 and 01_1
- area05 with road patterns 05_0, 05_1, and 05_2

These configurations were identified as outliers and analysed to understand why
high-risk host locations can be poorly detected despite apparently sufficient
road coverage.
